# SQL

The project in this folder was an assignment completed for The George Washington University Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.

When working with files in Employee SQL folder if you would like to see the schema please open `Employee_ERD.png` to set up the tables in this schema please run `employee_schema.sql`.

If you would like to populate the tables in Employee Database please run the  file `table_setup.sql`.

After you have run `table_setup.sql` you may run `employee_queries.sql`, or the `Employee_Bonus_SQL.ipynb`files in any order you wish. These files query the tables created in `table_setup.sql`

Please note, when running `Employee_Bonus_SQL.ipynb` file you must enter your username and password for postgreSQL in the first cell.
